This is a simple daemon for the WD-My Cloud Mirror gen2 and Ex2 ultra NAS system.

  It was developed on knowledge gained from reverse-engineering and spying 
  on the a D-Link dns320l system software.
  Parts of this work are based on fan-daemon.py by Lorenzo Martignoni and

How it works
============

  On bootup, dns320l-daemon is executed and runs as a deamon. On startup, the 
  daemon can optionally read the RTC and set the system time to the RTC time.
  It also sends the DeviceReady command to the MCU so that the Power LED stops
  blinking.
  Afterwards, it goes to fan control loop.

  If the daemon is killed (e.g. during system shutdown), it sends the 
  DeviceShutdown command with a timeout of 10 seconds to the MCU. After 10
  seconds, the MCU kills power.

  For normal operation a socket server on port 57367 is provided. You can
  connect with any telnet client to this port and work with the device.
  Just type "help" for a list of available commands.
  
Installation
============

  Either compile the software on your NAS by typing "make" or cross-compile
  it from your host computer.
  Put the binary to /usr/bin and the config file to /etc. Adapt the parameters
  to your needs, leave to defaults if unsure.
  A systemd unit is provided which can be copied to /etc/systemd/system and
  enabled by running "systemctl enable mcm-daemon"
